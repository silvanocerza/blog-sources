I rewrote my blogging system from scratch thinking that I would use it more, and it kinda happened at the start, I wrote some new posts right away.

Though right now I find myself not writing as much, I'm not even reading that much these times to be fair.

I kinda feel I miss an important part of system to truly use it as I want it. 

I need to find the time to complete it.
